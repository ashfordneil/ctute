\begin{description}
 \item[\hypertarget{defn:array}{Array}] A variable, which contains multiple values intead of just one. 
 Individual values are accessed by their \texttt{index} within the array.
 In most C derived langages this is indicated with brackets.
 eg:
    \lstinline!scores[17]!
    
 In C, all the values have the same type and the size of the array is fixed 
 when it is created.
 
 \item[\hypertarget{defn:string}{String}] A sequence of characters which can be manipulated as a unit.
 In C dervied languages, they are usually written in code surrounded by double quotes\footnote{The widley known exception 
 is python, where single or double quotes can be used for strings.}.
 eg:
 \lstinline!"Welcome to C"!
