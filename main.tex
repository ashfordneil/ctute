% Design principles:
%  * this is not intended to be a textbook - it is supposed to support lectures or other reasources
%  * it is intended to be usable (if not optimal) as both a reference and as a tutorial
%  * forward concept references are to be avoided.  If something is presented as an example which
%    readers are supposed to learn from, then they should be able to understand everything in that example.
%    That is not to say concept explanations can't be iterated/elaborated on later
%  * System/environment specific details should be separated into their own files so they can be disabled/switched out.
%  * Except for small fragments, hypreref link to programs so they can be placed elsewhere in the document/floated.
%  * Only use widely available LateX packages --- distributed with or autodownload for most major LaTeX distributions.
%    Think you need to add a class or package to this repo, please think again.
%  * Content is to be restricted to standard-C99
