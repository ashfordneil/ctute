\section*{Strings}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Write a function called \texttt{mystrlen} which does the same job as the standard \texttt{strlen} function.
You are not permitted to call any standard C string functions.

Test it with the following:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
#include <stdio.h>

// your code here

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    if ((mystrlen("hello")==5) && (mystrlen("")==0)) {
        printf("Ok\n");
    } else {
        printf("No\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\item Write your own version of \texttt{strcpy} (mystrcpy) which does the same job.
You are not permitted to call any standard C string functions.
Write a test program to demonstrate your function is correct.

\item Write a function \lstinline!char* stringadd(const char* s1, const char* s2)! which takes two strings and 
returns a new string which contains \texttt{s1} followed by \texttt{s2}.
You are not permitted to call any standard C string functions.
Write a test program to confirm that your function is correct.

\item Write a function which reads a line of any length from a file, and returns it as a string.
You are not permitted to use \texttt{fgets}.
Write a test program to confirm that your function is correct.
 
\end{enumerate}
